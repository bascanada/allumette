                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
 any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
 your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For
 example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
 for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you
 received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
 rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
 can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
 users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such
 abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
 precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed
 this version of the GPL to prohibit that practice for those products.
 If such problems arise in other domains, we stand ready to extend this
 provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
 avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
 make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
 on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
 reproduction (including archival copies), modification, translation,
 "decompilation," disassembly, or reverse engineering of a work.

  A "contributor" is an author of the Program or an owner of copyright
 in the Program.

  An "essential patent claim" is a patent claim (herein "patent claim")
 which, without infringing it, could not be made, used, sold, imported,
 or otherwise propagated, of any covered work. To "licensing a patent
 claim" means to make, or convey to the party to whom the patent claim
 applies, permission to make, use, sell, sell for use, offer to sell,
 import, and otherwise propagate, the covered work, in the absence of
 having obtained, or been the subject of, a covenant not to sue, or an
 express license, by or from, the holder of the patent claim.

  A "contributor version" is one type of work. The person or entity
 who provides the Program, acting in their or its own name to offer for
 licensing, a covered work, is a "contributor version".

  The "contributor license" is the license under which the contributor
 offers a covered work.

  A "contribution" means any copyrightable work, other than the Program,
 which the contributor provides, in their or its own name, for licensing
 under the contributor license. A "contributor" is an author of the
 Program or an owner of copyright in the Program.

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it. "Object code" means any form of a work that
 is not source code.

  The "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
 any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
 family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
 incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a
 consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.
 For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used"
 means a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of
 the status of the particular user or of the particular user's use.
 "Consumer software" means software that is contained in or delivered with
 a User Product.

  An "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
 procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
 and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product
 from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
 suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
 code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
 modification has been made.

  "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 the source code for that work, including any associated interface
 definition files, and any scripts used to control compilation and
 installation of the object code, or to modify the work, including scripts
 to install libraries that are dynamically linked with the work. For
 example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
 generated by or associated with a work, or, if a work is a library, the
 complete source code for all modules it contains.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
 regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form is an "object
 code source".

 1. Source Code License.

  You may copy and distribute the Program's source code in any medium,
 with or without modifications, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an effective copyright notice, with
 the inclusion of at least the following four statements: (1) a notice
 that the Program is subject to the GNU General Public License as
 published by the Free Software Foundation; (2) a notice that the Program
 is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind; (3) a notice that the
 Program is made available under the GNU General Public License as
 published by the Free Software Foundation; and (4) a notice that you
 should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
 the Program.

 2. Object Code License.

  You may copy and distribute the Program's object code in any medium,
 with or without modifications, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an effective copyright notice, with
 the inclusion of at least the following four statements: (1) a notice
 that the Program is subject to the GNU General Public License as
 published by the Free Software Foundation; (2) a notice that the Program
 is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind; (3) a notice that the
 Program is made available under the GNU General Public License as
 published by the Free Software Foundation; and (4) a notice that you
 should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
 the Program.

 3. Other Rights.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
 rights granted to you by this License.

 4. Term and Termination.

  This License shall terminate automatically if you fail to comply with
 any term of this License.

 5. Limited Warranty.

  The Program is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The
 entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Program is with
 you. Should the Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all
 necessary servicing, repair or correction.

 6. Limitation of Liability.

  In no event will any contributor be liable to you for damages,
 including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages
 arising out of the use or inability to use the Program (including but
 not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses
 sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the Program to operate
 with any other programs), even if such contributor has been advised of
 the possibility of such damages.

 7. General Provisions.

  If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
 such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the
 remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

 8. Entire Agreement.

  This License constitutes the entire agreement between you and the
 contributor concerning the Program, and supersedes all prior agreements
 and understandings.

 9. Assignment.

  You may not assign this License or any of your rights or obligations
 under this License to any third party without the prior written consent
 of the contributor.

 10. Governing Law.

  This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
 laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws
 principles.

 11. Arbitration.

  Any dispute arising out of or relating to this License shall be
 submitted to binding arbitration in San Francisco, California. The
 arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the commercial
 arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.

 12. Miscellaneous.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed to limit any rights you may
 have under applicable law.
